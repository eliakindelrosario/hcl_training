## Exercise 1 - Show How To Use GIT

The objective of this exercise is to show how to use GIT and its features.

1. Create Git acocunt (if you don't have one)
2. Create a git project in your local machine
3. Push git project from local machine to git repository
4. Share git repository with lead for review

## Exercise 2 - Implement A Program with Exception Handling

Implement a java program that creates a student class with the following attributes:

    studentID
    studentName
    StudentMark

When initializing the class, make sure the data is recieved by scanner.

Note: You have to check the condition that if somebody input student mark as less than 0 or greater than 100 then your program throws an exeption. The excption should be a a user made custom exception.

## Exercise 3 - Implement A Program with Exception Handling

Write a java program to handle exception handling mechanism through user-oriented exception handling.

Lets say you deposit $600 in a saving account. You then withdraw $100. Now you have $500 remaining. If you attempt to widthdraw $600, your program should throw an InSufficientBalance Exception.

## Exercise 4 - String Manipulation

Write a java program showing the following String manipulation strategies:
**_ note: Use StringTokenizer and StringBuilder class for some of the examples _**

1. 'first_middle_last' to 'first:middle:last'
2. 'first_middle_last' to 'first middle last'
3. 'first middle last' to 'first middle last trevialdata'
4. 'dd/mm/yyyy' to day: dd month: mm year: yyyy
